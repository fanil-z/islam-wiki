<section1>
<p>When I moved to Germany I was telling my relatives and friends that you can actually express your concerns and opinions here. And I was amazed by that feature up until this spring when German government started to ban demonstrations in support for Peace in Palestine. </p>

<p>	I had a chance to talk to several Palestinians here in Berlin. All of them have relatives who were exiled from their homes, I did not ask about those who are dead. A lady from my Hajj agency who helped me with documents was born in Gaza. She showed me her German ID that states "XXX" as her nationality. Many Western countries still follow the one-sided narrative and do not recognize Palestine as an independent nation. Despite all the evidence that Palestine is being occupied by Israel. Despite United Nations declaring that Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory is illegal and The State of Palestine has been recognized by 139 of the 193 UN members. Despite all the evidence of human rights violations in Gaza and West Bank.</p>
	
<p>	Is it forbidden now to call for peace and to call to stop "flattening" residential areas? Since when it is an ongoing <b>Genocide</b>, killing thousands of civilians, children and babies is not condemned and considered as "did not do enough to underscore Israel’s right to self-defence"? Please, spare us some time and rid the world of your ignorance.</p>

<p>	We must condemn all the media that presents the fake narrative and covers for and overlooks heinous crimes. We must condemn all parties who are involved in killing children and civilians, including people who endorse and approve such atrocities. We must condemn the US government that has been arming Israel and escalating the conflict for decades. And even now <a href="(https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/18/us-vetoes-un-resolution-calling-for-humanitarian-pause-in-israel-hamas-war">US is putting veto on UN resolution calling for humanitarian ceasefire</a>.</p>
	
<p>	And most importantly, we, as individuals and as communities, must condemn ourselves for letting the world fall into miserable, unjust, and evil state again and again.</p>
	
<p>	And all the unjust journalists and bloodthirsty influencers should know that even though the media was not covering it, all these years, the Muslim world was watching all <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/report-israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/">brutal raids and killings of civilian Palestinians</a>. We very well remember what happened last Ramadan in Al Aqsa, we remember how <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/05/un-experts-demand-justice-al-jazeera-journalist-one-year-anniversary-her">IDF killed an American journalist reporting the raid at the Jenin refugee camp</a> and then attacked mourners at her funeral. The world knows about the <a href="<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGVgjS98OsU">Catastrophy of Al-Nakba</a> with 15000 Palestinians dead and 0.75 million forcefully expelled from their homes. The world knows about illegal evictions and inhumane conditions behind the walls of Gaza and the West Bank. Don't be surprised why people are on the streets.</p>
	
<p>	The prophet Mohammed  ﷺ  taught us to speak up when we see injustice. We have multiple hadiths that teach Muslims to condemn the oppressor, defend the oppressed and rely on evidence rather than emotion.</p>

<p>	All corrupt media and individuals should know that every single mosque in the world is and was praying for Palestine. In jamaa and separately. In jumah I hear a brother in sajdah whispering "Falestine, Falestine.." We pray and make dua for peace and we pray for justice.</p>
	
<p>	The chain of violence must stop, humanitarian aid unblocked, people must be helped to find their home again. The war criminals must face their trial and governments must come in terms for peace. We cannot allow another bloody war in the Middle East.</p>

<p>If you want to better understand what has been happening in Palestine, you can just quickly listen to what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> says about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict back in 2002. Pay attention to the part when he suggests to try <b>"the experiment of minimal honesty"</b>.</p>

<p>Our prophet  ﷺ  taught us to be a good people in all aspects of this dunya. </p>

<p>We have several hadith about answering to injustice which I found  </p>

<p>a Hadith narrated by Qays bin Abi Hazm, may Allah be pleased with him, who said:

<code>“I heard Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, say, ‘Oh you people! I hear you reciting this verse: ‘Oh you who believe! Worry about your own selves. If you follow the right guidance, no harm can come to you from those who are in error.’ (al-Ma’idah 5:105) But I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say: ‘Indeed when people see an oppressor but do not prevent him from doing evil, it is likely that Allah will punish them all.”</quote>

When we are sure that an evil was committed; not based on gossip or rumours, but strong evidence. Allah has stated clearly in the Qur’an in Surah al-Hujurat 49:6: 

<code>“Oh you who have believed, if a rebellious evil person comes to you with news, verify it…” We must be certain, through witnessing it ourselves or a testimony from someone who had witnessed it first-hand.</code>

Al-Nakba Catastrophy 
~15000 Palestinians dead  (roughly estimations)
750000 Palestinians forcefully expelled
more than 500 villages destroyed

The UN Partition Plan alloted 56% of the lands, through the Nakba, Israel captured 78% of the land. Only the Occupied West Bank and Gaza strip left. 
Today it is about 85% of the area, turning 6 million Palestinians into refugees without a homeland.

Ahla Al-Filestine was living in the are of Palestine and was under the rule of the Ottoman Empire.

1878, Major Religios populations in Palestine

- Christians 40588
- Jews 13942
 
Zionism appeared as a response to Anti-Semitic acts in Europe and Russia in late 1800s and early 1900s. Zioninst chose Palestie as their country. 

During WW1 the Arab independence movement and Britain made a pact to go against the Ottomans together.

Great Britain officially agreed to offer mutual assistance against the Ottoman Empire and then recognise and support the independence of the Arabs in all regions within the limits demanded by the Sherif of Mecca.

Arabs started revolts against Turks but the next year the Brittish issued a new declaration and betrayed the Arabs.
In 1917, without consulting the native Palestinian population, Great Britain issued the Balfour Declaration supporting the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.
As per the declaration, the Palestinians were referred as non-Jewish communities and were given civil and religios rights but not political rights.

In 1922, after WW1 ended, Britain gained control over Palestine through a mandate that required them to establish a national home for Jewish people in Palestine. So, between 1922 and 1931 the Jewish population in the area doubled from 83794 to 174610. The Zionists slogan was "A land without people for a people without land." Ignoring the fact that Palestinian people had been living there for generations. 

In 1931, Muslims and Christians were 851110. and Jews 174610. 
When Nazis came into government in Germany, Palestine became a haven for Jewish refugees.

Jewish settlers, The Jewish national fund purchased a lot of fertile land and evicted the farmers. That created a crisis of hundreds of thousands landless, dispossessed Palestinian-Arabs. This led to The Arab revolt (1936-1939). Palestinians fiercely rebelled against the Britting colonial forces and Jewish settlers but they were brutelly crushed by the Brittish. Britain put more troops than they had stationed in India at that time. Thousands of Palestinians were killed. And the Brittish started training the Zionist millitas to suppress the rebellion. 

In 1947, Britain gave up and handled the docision to the newly created UN.
The Partition Plan of UN shocked Palestinians. 
1947,
Muslims and Christians - 1.3mln
Jews - 0.63mln

56% of the lands which were also often the most fertile lands were offered to the Jewish state. There was also another problem, within tbe proposed area of the Jewish state were hundreds of thousands of Muslims and Christians who lived there for generations. The UN's decision shocked Palestinians and they did not accept it. The Jews accepted it and self-declared the State of Israel.

In the aftermath of the Holocaust and after lobbying from US leaders and Zionists, the UN votes in favor of partition. 

As soon as the Brittish forces left Palestine, the Zionist millitary forces Haganah and more extremist militia Irgun adopted the Plan Dalet the goal of which was to gain control of the Jewish state.
