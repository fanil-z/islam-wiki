Abu Bakr's tribe refused to give him protection, so he also decided to migrate. 
 ibn Dagina saw hom migrating and said he will give his protection to Abubakr. he was a chieftan of a neighboring tribe.

Quraish allowed but said he cannot pray publicly. Abubakr extended his house and begins praying out loud. he actually made a first mesjit.

people would gather around to listen to his recitation.
Quraish said now he cant pray in his house too.
Abubakr gave his protection back to Dagina and chose the protection of Allah.
the migrants came back. 

other Uthman was under protecion of al Walid and he returned it because he felt guilt wihle other muslims were prosecuted.

Emigrants went back to Abyssinia. the Quraish went to najashi with presents and said he must give them the migrants. the Najashi said I will listen to their story. Jagfar and all people came and made his famous speech.

Isa told this to the prophets.
Dajjal will come, then Isa AS will come and Dajjal will melt. then people will come to their lands and then Wadjuj and Madjuj will come out and drink all the water. untill Isa AS wil make dua to kill them and they will all die. and the lands will be covered b their bodies. IsaAS will make another dua to get rid of the bodies and Allah will send rain and bodies will be washed away. At this time it will be like a pregnant woman ready to give birth. 


Malik the guardian of hell never smiles even when said salam to the prophet  ﷺ   . Jibreel said Were he to have smiled to anybody that would have been you.

The first thing Allah created is the Pen.
Allah said 50 salah a day. Musa said the the prophet  ﷺ    go back to your Lord and ask to reduce the number of prayers. the prophet  ﷺ    went up and back 5 or 10 times until it was reduced to 5. So the Voice said it is decreed 5 salah but it will be rewarded with 50.

there are 5 layers of Qadr. daily and yearly Qadr may change.
Celebration of the prophet's ﷺ    birthday started 600 years after his death. many of scholars opposed it.

clay is made to build and fire is made to destroy

ABRAHAM'S prayer was answered, and rich gifts were continually
brought to Mecca by the pilgrims who came to visit the Holy House
in increasing numbers from all parts of Arabia and beyond. The
Greater Pilgrimage was made once a year; but the Ka'bah could also be
honoured through a lesser pilgrimage at any time; and these rites continued to be performed with fervour and devotion according to the rules
which Abraham and Ishmael had established. The descendants of Isaac
also venerated the Ka'bah, as a temple that had been raised by Abraham.
For them it counted as one of the outlying tabernacles of the Lord. But as
the centuries passed the purity of the worship of the One God came to be
contaminated. The descendants of Ishmael became too numerous to live
all in the valley of Mecca; and those who wentto settle elsewhere took with
them stones from the holy precinct and performed rites in honour of them.
Later, through the influence of neighbouring pagan tribes, idols came to be
added to the stones; and finally pilgrims began to bring idols to Mecca.
These were set up in the vicinity of the Ka'bah, and it was then that the
Jews ceased to visit the temple of Abraham.'
The idolaters claimed that their idols were powers which acted as
mediators between God and men. As a result, their approach to God
became less and less direct, and the remoter He seemed, the dimmer
became their sense of the reality of the World-to-come, until many of them
ceased to believe in life after death. But in their midst, for those who could
interpret it, there was a clear sign that they had fallen away from the truth:
they no longer had access to the Well of Zamzam, and they had even
forgotten where it lay. The jurhumites who had come from the Yemen
were directly responsible. They had established themselves in control of
Mecca, and the descendants of Abraham had tolerated this because
Ishmael's second wife was a kinswoman of Jurhum; but the time came
when the Jurhumites began to commit all sorts of injustices, for which they
were finally driven out; and before they left they buried the Well of
Zamzam. No doubt they did this by way of revenge, but it was also likely
that they hoped to return and enrich themselves from it, for they filledit up
with part of the treasure of the sanctuary, offerings of pilgrims which had
accumulated in the Ka'bah over the years; then they covered it with sand. 


e. The voices were
now not far off - five or six men at least- and they were still approaching.
The Prophet looked at Abu Bakr, and said: Grieve not, for verily God is
with us.! And then he said: "What thinkest thou of two when God is their
third?"? They could now hear the sound of steps, which drew nearer and
then stopped: the men were standing outside the cave. They spoke
decisively, all in agreement that there was no need to enter the cave, since
no one could possibly be there. Then they turned back the way they had
come.
When the sound of their retreating steps and voices had died away, the
Prophet and Abu Bakr went to the mouth of the cave. There in front of it,
almost covering the entrance, was an acacia tree, about the height of a
man, which had not been there that morning; and over the gap that was left
between the tree and the wall of the cave a spider had woven its web. They
looked through the web, and there in the hollow of a rock, even where a
man might step as he entered the cave, a rock dove had made a nesting
place and was sitting close as if she had eggs, with her mate perched on a
ledge not far above.

Mesopotamia:
    1. Ubaid period (6500-3800bc)
    early village settlements. all population engaged in the production of food.

    the increasing food surplus allowed the creation of other professions like merchants, craftsmen, weavers, metallurges. the taxation and redistribution of food supply led to creation of governments. city of Uruq prospered.
    Society hierarchy appeared. The high priest had leading role in a temple, keppers scribes administrators and priests and at the bottom were producers: farmers and fishermen. Cineaform writing appeared. 

There's the whole science that studies the authenticity of Hadith. People study four years at the university to distinguish between authentic and non-authentic hadith.

### David in the Bible

This was after Samson.

The temple built by jinns 🏛️

Angels Harut and Marut taught magic in Babylon (between 1895BC and 539BC). it is mentioned in the Quran.

Iqrimah ibn Abu Jahl flees. but later he comes to Medina to accept Islam from the hands of the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   .

His Prophetic mission began on the 27th day of the month of Rajab, in the year 610 CE, when he received the first divine revelation. Then the Qur’an was revealed to the Prophet progressively according to the circumstances of the time over a period of 23 years.

There is a narration that Abi-Talib took the prophet  ﷺ    with him and the monk from the monastery told that this boy will be the prophet. This narration is not authentic and that story was most probably invented.
Solitude of shepherd gives opportunity to contemplate on the nature and teaches how to rule. Also, sheep shepherds are the most humble shepherds.

According to the Bible lifespan of people before THe Great Flood was much longer than after the flood.

Consider homosexuality for example. It is prohibited by the major religions of the world. Until the 20th century, it was considered immoral and a punishable offence in the US.

Now it has become so rampant that those who disapprove of it, let alone denounce it, are labeled as “intolerant and narrow-minded.” It is being promoted and celebrated widely to make it popular. Even the cartoons that children watch increasingly include homosexual references.


In Abrahamic religions, the common things are beliveing in the God of Abraham, believe in the concept of prophets and believe in the Judgement Day. 
Other large group of religions is dharmic religions that includes Hinduism and Buddism and Jainism. INstead of Judgement day they believe in reincarnation. they also believe in some sort of judgement: Karma.

### Other incidents

The sayings of Muhammad (hadith), Islamic literature and Quranic exegesis also narrate some incidents of the life of Musa. One story goes that he is bathing apart from the other Israelites who all bathe together. This leads the Bani Israels to say that Musa does so due to a scrotal hernia. One day, when Musa is bathing in seclusion, he puts his clothes on a stone, and the stone flees with his clothes. Musa rushes after the stone, and when the Bani Israels see him, they say, 'By Allah, Musa has got no defect in his body". Musa then beats the stone with his clothes, and Abu Huraira 🐈 states, "By Allah! There are still six or seven marks present on the stone from that excessive beating". In a hadith, Muhammad states that the stone still has three to five marks due to Musa hitting it.

atheism is very recent phenomena.
the first person to proclaim himself an atheist was Nitzsche whos gone mad in his last years.1844 – 1900


Jewish Calendar and Orthodox Chiristians believe that people have been around the Earth for around 6 thousand years. It is not the islamic view.

There are some cave paintings that are 30thousand years old. These were not Neanthertals these were Homo-Sapiens.

So we have no problem assuming that the gyneology between Adam And Ismail tool 10-20 thousand years. The prophet ﷺ    said that the time between now and the Day of Judgement is like his two fingers. And now it is 1443 year after Hijrah. So it gives possibility to extend the humanity timeline as long as science findings. We don't have a set timeframe.

After death of prophet Muhammad's ﷺ   son, Allah sent the sura Kawsar.

    Verily, we have blessed You with Al Kauthar (a river in Paradise). So,offer prayer and sacrifice to your Lord. Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off.

> Narrated Anas bin Malik: One day the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was sitting amongst us that he dozed off. He then raised his head smilingly. We said: What makes you smile. Messenger of Allah? He said: A Sura has just been revealed to me, and then recited: In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful. Verily We have given thee Kauthar (fount of abundance). Therefore, turn to thy Lord for prayer and offer sacrifice, and surely thy enemy is cut off (from the good). Then he (the Prophet) said: Do you know what Kauthar is? We said: Allah and His Messenger know best. The Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: It (Kauthar) is a canal which my Lord, the Exalted and Glorious has promised me, and there is an abundance of good in it. It is a cistern and my people would come to it on the Day of Resurrection, and tumblers there would be equal to the number of stars. A servant would be turned away from (among the people gathered there). Upon this I would say: My Lord, he is one of my people, and He (the Lord) would say: You do not know that he innovated new things (in Islam) after you. Ibn Hujr made this addition in the hadith:" He (the Prophet) was sitting amongst us in the mosque, and He (Allah) said: (You don't know) what he innovated after you"

Abdallah ibn Zubayr separated and made his own khaliphate. he rebuilt te Kaaba and followed the hadith.
He was crucified in front of the Kaaba and that man destroyed it and rebuilt it.
